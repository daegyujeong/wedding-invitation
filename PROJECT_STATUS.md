## 🎯 Immediate Action Items

### 1. **Complete Task #11** (5 minutes)
```bash
task-master set-status --id=11 --status=done
```
**Why**: All subtasks are done, should be marked complete.

### 2. **Start Foundation Work** (URGENT)
```bash
task-master set-status --id=1 --status=in-progress
task-master expand --id=1  # Break into subtasks
```
**Why**: Unblocks 88% of the project.

### 3. **Complete Map Widgets** (When API keys available)
```bash
task-master set-status --id=17 --status=in-progress
```
**What's needed**:
